# Amazon_Clone-HTML-CSS

I'm excited to share that I've recently built an Amazon Clone Website using only HTML and CSS. This project helped me in understanding of front-end development fundamentals, including:
 ✅ Responsive Layout Design
 ✅ Flexbox & Grid Usage
 ✅ Clean and Structured HTML & CSS Code.
I’m continuously learning and would love to connect with others in the tech and design space. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
